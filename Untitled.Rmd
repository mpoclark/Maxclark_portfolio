# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
library(readr)
movies <- read_csv("~/Desktop/data/movies.csv")
View(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}

table <- movies %>% 
  
#Filtering data for mussing values & choosing the two previously named directors
  filter(!is.na(rating), director == 'Steven Spielberg' | director == 'Tim Burton') %>%
  group_by(director) %>% 
  
#Required statistic calculation
  summarise(mean_1= mean(rating), mean = round(mean_1, digits = 2), sd= sd(rating), t_critical=qt(.95, n() - 1), standard_error=sd(movies$rating)/sqrt(n()), lower_95_1 = mean - t_critical*(standard_error), upper_95_1 = mean + t_critical*(standard_error), lower_95= round(lower_95_1, digits = 2),upper_95= round(upper_95_1, digits = 2) )

  filter(director == 'Steven Spielberg') %>% 
  select(lower_95)

  filter(director == 'Tim Burton') %>% 
  select(upper_95)

#Let's shade the common CI of the two directors.
