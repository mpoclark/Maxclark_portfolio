<h1>Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance</h1>
<p>Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm">Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)</a> survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.</p>
<div id="load-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Load the data</h2>
<p>This data is part of the <code>openintro</code> textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:</p>

<p>Before you carry on with your analysis, it’s is always a good idea to check with <code>skimr::skim()</code> to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>You will first start with analyzing the <code>weight</code> of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>distribution_weight &lt;- yrbss %&gt;% 
select(weight) %&gt;% 
filter(!is.na(weight)) %&gt;% #Ensuring the filtering out of missing data points


summarise(mean=mean(weight),SD=sd(weight),median=median(weight),min=min(weight),max=max(weight))

distribution_weight #calculation display </code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 5
##    mean    SD median   min   max
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1  67.9  16.9   64.4  29.9  181.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(yrbss,aes(x=weight))+  #plot building
  geom_density()+ 
  labs(title=&quot;Weights distribution appears approximately normal&quot;)+ 
  xlab(&quot;Weight (kg)&quot;)+ #axis labelling
  theme_bw() </code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog4_files/figure-html/eda_on_weight-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There is 1004 missing data (variable weight), and the graphs clearly show that the distribution is right-skewed. However, we can notice that it is still a bell shape and so it is quite normally distributed.</p>
<p>Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.</p>
<p>Let’s create a new variable <code>physical_3plus</code>, which will be <code>yes</code> if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and <code>no</code> otherwise.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>yrbss &lt;- yrbss %&gt;% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d &gt;= 3, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;))

yrbss %&gt;% filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %&gt;% 
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 3
##   physical_3plus count  prop
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 no              4404 0.331
## 2 yes             8906 0.669</code></pre>
<p>Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are <em>NOT</em> active 3 or more days per week?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>inactive_CI &lt;- yrbss %&gt;%
  specify(response = physical_3plus, success=&quot;no&quot;) %&gt;% 
  
  
  generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) %&gt;%
  calculate(stat = &quot;prop&quot;) 
percentile_ci &lt;- inactive_CI %&gt;%
  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) #choosing level of confidence

percentile_ci</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   lower_ci upper_ci
##      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1    0.323    0.339</code></pre>
<p>Make a boxplot of <code>physical_3plus</code> vs. <code>weight</code>. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>yrbss %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %&gt;% 
ggplot(aes(x=physical_3plus,y=weight)) + geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title=&quot; Relationship between physical activity &amp; weight&quot;)+
  theme_bw()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Thanks to this graphs, we can clearly demonstrate that there is a correlation between physical activity and weight.As Median for people who do physical activity is a bit higher but because there is high weight outliers in the group without physical activity, we can condlude that there practice sport prevents from having a really high weight.</p>
</div>
<div id="confidence-interval" class="section level2">
<h2>Confidence Interval</h2>
<p>Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean/SD, etc weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the <code>na.rm = TRUE</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>yrbss %&gt;%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %&gt;% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
  count = n(),
  se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
  t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
  margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
  lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
  upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
    )</code></pre>

## 1 no                    66.7      17.6  4404     0.266       1.96

## # … with 3 more variables: margin_of_error &lt;dbl&gt;, lower &lt;dbl&gt;, upper &lt;dbl&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.</p>
</div>
<div id="hypothesis-test-with-formula" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis test with formula</h2>
<p>Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.</p>
<p>H0: Mean weights of students who exercise 3 or more times a week = Mean weights of students who exercise who do not</p>
<p>H1: Mean weights of students who exercise 3 or more times a week != Mean weights of students who exercise who do not</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

</div>
<div id="hypothesis-test-with-infer" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis test with <code>infer</code></h2>
<p>Next, we will introduce a new function, <code>hypothesize</code>, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.</p>
<p>But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as <code>obs_diff</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>obs_diff &lt;- yrbss %&gt;%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %&gt;% #specifying the variable for which mean is 
  #calculated and the variable in which these means are going to differ
  calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) #choosing the statistics: difference in means
#choosing order to satisfy the null hypothesis of yes - no != 0
obs_diff</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##    stat
##   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1  1.77</code></pre>
<p>Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.</p>
<p>After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>null_dist &lt;- yrbss %&gt;%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %&gt;%
  hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) %&gt;%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) %&gt;%
  calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>hypothesize</code> is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to <em>point</em> to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.</p>
<p>Also, note that the <code>type</code> argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.</p>
<p>We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, fill=&quot;dark blue&quot;)+
  labs(title=&quot;The null distribution is normal&quot;)+
  theme_stata()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least <code>obs_stat</code> of 1.77?</p>
<p>We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function <code>infer::get_p_value()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>null_dist %&gt;% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;two-sided&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>null_dist %&gt;%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = &quot;two_sided&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##   p_value
##     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1       0</code></pre>
<p>This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.</p>
